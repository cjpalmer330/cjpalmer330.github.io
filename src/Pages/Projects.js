              THIS PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
            </h3>
            <h1>
              This website was a spawn child of my time off during Thanksgiving. I started with only having ever done very minimal work with JS and HTML native. I decided creating a project of this type would help me learn the React-Tailwind tech stack!

            CUBE TIMER

          <h1>
            My first introduction to JavaScript and HTML was this personal Rubik's Cube Timer App. I decided on such a product as I had switched from an Android to an IPhone, which didn't have the app I was using at the time to time my Rubik's cube solves. So I decided to make my own!

              In my first semester at UTD I took the requisite Data Structures and Algorithms course, which turned out being my favorite course of the year.Not only because of my amazing professor, but also because I was able to apply our in course topics to write an Airline flight planner!

              Goodreads Clone
            </h3>
            <h1>
              This is still work in progress, however it is showing great potential. The idea of the site came to me as I enjoy reading in my free time, and wish that I had a place like goodreads which allowed me to track all the books I read, but actually displayed some stats about those books. I wanted to be able to see the genres I read the most, or the page length of books over the year. And So starting over Thanksgiving break I began work on my clone!
