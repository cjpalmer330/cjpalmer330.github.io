            When my Thanksgiving break week started, I was given freedom to choose how I spend my next 11 days, whether to be productive or not.
            I knew that although I have done some work with JS, HTML, and CSS before, my skills weren't where they needed to be to obtain an internship the upcoming summer.
            So I decided that I would spend my thanksgiving trying out the React-Tailwind tech stack. I wasn't planning on building a portfolio website,
            I just new I needed to actually try making something cohesive in order to truly understand the interplay between components. As such I dove head first into tail wind,
            going through the documentation and old StackOverflow posts from 7,8 years ago everytime I came across an obstacle. I proved to myself in a very short amount of time,
            that I am able to take steps towards learning a new technology, and do so under my own direction.
